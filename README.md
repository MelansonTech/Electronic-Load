This project focuses on the development of an electronic load capable of simulating variable load conditions for power supplies, battery testing, and component evaluation. The system supports 60VDC input and offers two selectable current ranges (0.35A and 10A) with a maximum power dissipation of 150W. A user-friendly interface utilizing an LCD display, push buttons, and a rotary encoder enables intuitive control and real-time monitoring, making it an ideal solution for a variety of testing and development environments.

Key Features:
Voltage Range: Supports up to 60VDC, making it suitable for testing a wide range of power sources and battery packs.
Current Ranges: Provides two selectable current ranges:
0.35A: For precision testing of low-power devices.
10A: Ideal for testing higher-power sources.
Max Power Dissipation: Handles up to 150W, ensuring the load can simulate realistic conditions for more demanding power supplies and battery packs.
User Interface: Features an intuitive interface with an LCD display, push buttons, and a rotary encoder for easy control of settings like voltage, current, and power.
Constant Current and Voltage Modes: Can simulate constant current and voltage scenarios, which are essential for power testing applications.
Safety Features: Includes built-in protections for over-voltage, over-current, and thermal management to ensure safe operation.
System Components:
LCD Display: The LCD screen provides real-time feedback of the loadâ€™s voltage, current, and power status. This allows the user to easily monitor load conditions and adjust settings accordingly.
Rotary Encoder: The rotary encoder allows users to adjust the voltage, current, and power settings precisely, offering a smooth and responsive way to set values. It provides fine control for both high and low settings.
Push Buttons: Push buttons enable users to toggle between different settings, switch between current ranges, and confirm selections.
Load Control Circuit: Uses high-power MOSFETs or similar devices to draw and control the current drawn by the load. The circuit ensures voltage and current stability within the specified ranges.
Cooling System: Active or passive cooling ensures that the system stays within safe temperature limits, especially under high-power operation.
Working Principle:
Voltage Control: Users can set the voltage up to 60VDC via the rotary encoder. The electronic load will regulate the current to match the selected voltage and current range.

Current Regulation: The system offers two current ranges:

0.35A Range: Ideal for testing low-power devices or for high-precision current control.
10A Range: Used for higher current tests, simulating demanding load conditions.
The system continuously adjusts resistance to maintain the set current, ensuring it does not exceed the 150W power dissipation limit.

UI Feedback and Control:

Rotary Encoder: Rotate the encoder to increase or decrease voltage or current. The LCD updates in real-time to reflect these changes.
Push Buttons: Use the buttons to toggle between modes (constant current/voltage), select current ranges, or confirm changes.
Power Dissipation: The load can dissipate up to 150W of power, with real-time power feedback visible on the LCD. The system adjusts dynamically to prevent exceeding power limits, ensuring both the load and power source remain safe.

Applications:
Power Supply Testing: Test the performance and stability of DC power supplies across a wide range of voltages and currents.
Battery Discharge Testing: Simulate various load conditions for testing battery performance under realistic scenarios.
Component Evaluation: Assess other electronic components such as voltage regulators and current sources by testing them under controlled load conditions.
R&D and Prototyping: Ideal for engineers and researchers who need precise load control during the development of new power electronics.
Production Testing: A useful tool for manufacturing environments where testing power devices is essential for quality assurance.
Design Considerations:
Precision and Accuracy: The load must deliver precise control over voltage, current, and power, ensuring accurate and repeatable results.
Thermal Management: Since the load operates up to 150W, efficient cooling is critical for preventing thermal failure and ensuring reliable operation.
Safety Mechanisms: Built-in protections for over-voltage, over-current, and over-temperature safeguard the system during operation.
User-Friendly Interface: The LCD display, push buttons, and rotary encoder provide a simple and effective way for users to interact with the system and monitor its status.
